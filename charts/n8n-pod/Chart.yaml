  Industrial workflow automation with n8n. Because sometimes your factory needs
  to talk to 47 different APIs, and you'd rather not write Python scripts at 3am.
  
  n8n is a fair-code workflow automation platform for technical teams. Perfect for
  integrating industrial systems, automating data pipelines, connecting MQTT to APIs,
  triggering actions from sensor data, and building complex automation flows without
  coding. Think Node-RED's professional cousin with 400+ integrations out of the box.
