  Industrial-grade Traefik ingress controller for edge computing and factory automation.
  Because manually configuring nginx reverse proxies at 2am is nobody's idea of fun.
  
  Traefik is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying
  microservices easy. Perfect for routing traffic to your industrial pods (MQTT,
  InfluxDB, Node-RED, etc.) with automatic SSL, dashboard monitoring, and zero-downtime
  deployments. Supports Docker, Kubernetes, and every protocol your factory floor throws at it.
