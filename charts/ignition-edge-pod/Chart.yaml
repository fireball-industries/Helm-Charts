  Production-ready Ignition Edge for Kubernetes - Because your operators deserve 
  better than a Windows XP touchscreen running FactoryTalk from 2005.
  
  Industrial IoT/SCADA/HMI platform with OPC UA, MQTT Sparkplug B, and enough 
  protocol support to make even the crustiest PLC tech crack a smile.
  
  Defaults to demo mode (2-hour sessions) - activate your license unless you enjoy 
  watching your gateway restart during critical production runs.
